# Writing a C to Brainfuck compiler from scratch - Part 1

Welcome to Part 1 of a series of posts that will (hopefully) teach you to write
your own C compiler from scratch. 

Why would you want to do this? I don't know, I don't know what I am doing with
my life. I mean, look, I am probably going to spend 500+ hours of my life writing
a compiler that only I am going to use, so maybe you just want to go ahead and
answer these existential questions yourself.

As an added benefit, we will not be compiling to the usual assembly code
like normal(read: useful) compilers. No we don't care about people using our
code. We like our code to face the same existential dread that we do, and so we
will compile down to the [esoteric](), soul-crushing, completely impractical, 
[turing tar pit]() of a language [BrainFuck](). 

Wait, sorry, BrainF\*ck. Forgot to censor myself there. My apologies to the 
impressionable underage compiler enthusiasts that makes up 98% of my audience.
